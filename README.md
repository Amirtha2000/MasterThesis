MasterThesis is the complete, reproducible research environment for my Master’s thesis “Measuring Spatial Memory Using 3D-Sketch Maps in Vertically Aligned and Rotated Multilevel Environments Using Virtual Reality.”

This repository consolidates everything used in the experiment — the Unity executable environments, VResin custom drawing tool (developed by Tianyi Xiao), compiled executables, Python pipelines for mesh cleaning and 2D projection, and R scripts for statistical modeling (GLMMs, emmeans).

The goal is to make every step — from a participant’s virtual 3D sketch to the final quantitative accuracy score — fully traceable, version-controlled, and rerunnable. Each component (VR tool, .obj-to-.png converter, and scoring scripts) follows open-science principles for methodological transparency and reproducibility.
